## 1.1.0

- Rewrite of tests as dart:io is sketchy when under test; instead we'll use
  an external process to read and write files on command.
- Tests have extra waits in them because some OSs are slow.

## 1.0.2

- I did it all for the pub points (documentation)

## 1.0.1

- Renames 

## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
